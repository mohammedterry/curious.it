SPACE - CREATING THE ANIMATED BACKGROUND
This website is all about A.I. and will showcase some of our company's latest projects.
The background has a solar system which is animated using CSS (to allow planets to orbit around the sun)
and .gif files (to allow the planets to spin)

This may seem like cheating - but its far more efficient and not computationally intensive at all
(There is absolutely no Javascript used yet)
P.s. although the sizes and distances are not to scale, the timing of the orbits are relatively accurate!

However, JS is used to animate the swarm of alien spacecrafts!
They interact and explore around the screen as a swarm
They will also follow your cursor
