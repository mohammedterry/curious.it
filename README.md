SPACE - CREATING THE ANIMATED BACKGROUND

The background has a solar system which is animated using CSS (to allow planets to orbit around the sun)

and the planets are .gif files to allow them to spin (This may seem like a bit of a cheat - but its far more efficient and less computationally intensive)

(There is absolutely no Javascript used yet)
P.s. although the sizes and distances are not to scale, the timing of the orbits are relatively accurate!

However, JS is used to animate the swarm of alien spacecrafts!
They interact and explore around the screen as a swarm
They will also follow your cursor
