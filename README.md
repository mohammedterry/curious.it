Our website is all about A.I. and should be up and running soon...
It is designed to showcase some of the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence 
as well as some cool AI implementations.

# Animating the Background (HTML & CSS only!)

The background has a solar system which is animated using CSS (to allow planets to orbit around the sun)

and the planets are .gif files to allow them to spin (This may seem like a bit of a cheat - but its far more efficient and less computationally intensive)

(There is absolutely no Javascript used yet)
P.s. although the sizes and distances are not to scale, the timing of the orbits are relatively accurate!

# Swarms (JS only)

However, JS is used to animate the swarm of alien spacecrafts!
They interact and explore around the screen as a swarm
They will also follow your cursor

As you can see.  All these cool background animations are only frontend (freeing up the backend for the real A.I.) ;)

# To be continued...
MORE UPDATES COMING SOON...
